	<h4>About Project Sobeys</h4>
	<p>YawHide is a multi platform application.</p>
	<p>The goal of Project Sobeys is to ultimately let its users save money by being able to sort and easily find the best deals in their local grocery flyers.</p>
	<p>Project Sobeys only supports Sobeys for now, but in the very near future, it will support a lot more grocery stores. Canada only as well!</p>
