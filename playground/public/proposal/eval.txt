Web Services:  some stuff is at api.uwaterloo.ca (public data).  The
personal data (courses they're taking) you'll need to get from 
cs349.student.cs...

The sequence diagram and schematics aren't making sense to
me when compared to your overview.  I don't understand why 
the user needs to add events and search for locations etc
when all the stuff you've listed (courses, exams) are known
via the api (well, you did list midterms; that isn't).

Please update to clarify.
